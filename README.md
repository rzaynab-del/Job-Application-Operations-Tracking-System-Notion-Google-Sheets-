# Job Application & Operations Tracking System

## Overview
This project demonstrates a system I designed to track job applications and operational tasks for clients. It focuses on **organization, follow-up, and reporting**, ensuring nothing slips through the cracks. The system is built for Virtual Assistant, Admin, and Operations roles and shows how I maintain clarity, structure, and accountability in workflows.

## Tools Used
- **Google Sheets** – task tracking, application logs, and reports  
- **Notion** – project boards, task lists, deadlines, and priorities  
- **Google Drive** – document organization and version control  
- **Excel & Word** – preparing templates and reports  
- **Optional:** AI tools like ChatGPT for drafting and summarizing tasks

## System Structure
- **Task Tracker** – logs all job applications or operational tasks with details:  
  - Task/Project Name  
  - Status (Pending / Completed / Follow-up)  
  - Owner/Assignee  
  - Due Date  
  - Notes / Comments  

- **Follow-Up Log** – tracks reminders and follow-ups to ensure deadlines are met.  

- **Weekly Status Report** – summary of completed tasks, pending actions, and upcoming priorities. Can be shared as Markdown or PDF.

## Workflow
1. Add new tasks or applications to the tracker as soon as they are identified.  
2. Assign owners (if working in a team) and set deadlines.  
3. Check progress daily and update status.  
4. Follow up on stalled or overdue items.  
5. Generate a **weekly summary report** with progress, blockers, and next steps.  
6. Maintain all files organized in Google Drive for easy access and version control.
